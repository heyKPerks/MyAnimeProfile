# MyAnimeProfile
My purpose for this project is to create a fun custom space to share a bit about myself and my enthusiasm for anime!

My focus is for the design to be responsive, modular, and driven by the content. This would allow me to scale my project as I added more topics and elements.

The technologies I used are HTML, CSS, CSS Grids, Flexbox, and vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks were used.  

Feel free to connect and chat or judge my trash taste and spaghetti code.
